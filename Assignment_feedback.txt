1. Is this assignment accessible given the machine learning lectures and your python experience?
Yes.

2. What did you enjoy about this assignment?
I was curious about CNN and I have not seen how they were used before this assingment. So I enjoyed looking at how to build a CNN.

3. What could make this assignment more interesting to you? (different type of dataset, more hands-on coding, ect.)
More hands-on coding would definately be more helpful. And focusing on omics data set would be more conveniant as well. 

4. What was your biggest challenge with this assignment?
My biggest challenge was understanding the different steps taken in each part of the assingment, especially that I have not built similar models before, using the same methods. 

5. Roughly, how long did you spend on this assignment? Was it feasible given your current workload?
Around 3 hours. 


6. Is there anything that you are intersted in learning about machine learning that we did not cover in the lectures and assignment?
Focusing more on omics data.
